        Effective date: 11 February 2019 <br><br>

        By using this website/app (oSay), you are acknowledging that you are over 18 years of age and you willfully chose
			 	to visit this website and view its content willingly. By visiting this website, you also agree to abide by the
				following. These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time.<br><br>

        The point of this (oSay) app/webapp/website is to foster a healthy forum for users to vent and get their thoughts,
        feelings, burdens, etc. off their chest as well as to celebrate the good things and good people in their lives.
        If the content is positive or even if it's negative but necessary (getting things off your chest, venting about
        work, people, relationships, etc.), it will be allowed and encouraged. Please also take the time to reply to other
        users with encouraging and uplifting words, advice, resources, funny and thought provoking remarks, etc. We want it
        to feel like home, and we want it to be fun and entertaining.<br><br>

        We will kick you off this app if you use our app in a way that wasn't intended that produces negativity. We will gladly
        volunteer your email and other identifying information to the authorities if we feel like you have any intention to
        harm others or break the law. We at oSay are at liberty to define what we consider harmful and this includes but isn't
        limited to trolling, spamming, threatening, harrassing, etc. We will also gladly give your email and any
        other identifying information to the authorities if you make threats concerning ANYTHING. We don't play that.
        Not even a little bit. Again, we at oSay are at liberty to define whatever we think is a threat or threatening so you might
        say something that you think is innocent trolling, but if we don't see it as that, we will gladly report it.
        AGAIN, if you post anything that is even close to being considered a threat to anyone or anything, it will be
        IMMEDIATELY reported to the police. We will	protect our users' rights to privacy; however, you forfeit that privilege when
        you post anything that can be seen as harmful, threatening, or warrants an investigation.We at oSay are allowed to limit or
        terminate you from this app with no notification or explanation whatsoever at any time. So if you decide to use this app,
        respectthe community and atmosphere that we are
        trying to develop.<br><br>

        What won't be allowed is users trying to put other users or even people in general inside or outside the app.
        We're trying to promote understanding. Not everything is justified, but if you put yourself in someone's shoes,
        you can gain an understanding an appreciation for who they are and where they're coming form. Disagreements happen
        and that's ok, but what we won't tolerate is people trying to make others feel bad about who they are and what they
        believe. Just leave it alone. You might think they're wrong and they're the devil for how they think and feel. We
        don't care. Leave it alone. Skip over that post. Keep scrolling. Or RESPECTFULLY disagree. Don't just start berating
        them and start calling them all these "_phobics" and talk about how they promote all these "_isms." It's fine. Just
        leave it alone and move on. You're responsible for your own feelings. Deal with it.<br><br>

        And since we're all humans from different walks of life, you will most likely see content that you would consider offensive.
        Obviously this is a community and so there are different viewpoints. Deal with your feelings in a healthy way. You
        can even engage the person to see why they think what they think RESPECTFULLY. What you will NOT do is approach them
        aggressively and/or in a rude manner. You're not the only one here. You're sharing the space. So be respectful of those
        around you but if you don't like something you see, engage respectfully, or LEAVE IT ALONE.<br><br>

        **SUICIDE PREVENTION AND POLICY**<br>
        If you say anything concerning suicide, we will contact the authorities so that they can contact your loved
        ones. We are doing this for your sake. We understand that times can get really hard, trust me we've been there,
        but here at oSay, we do not believe suicide is the answer, and we will do everything we can to prevent you
        from ending your own life even if that means we have to report the situation to the authorities. We hope to create a
        space where our community will quickly rally around you to change your mind and encourage you but again, WE
        WILL CONTACT AUTHORITIES REGARDING ANY SUICIDAL REMARKS in order to prevent any tragic loss of life because
        we care about you and are really concerned about the place you may be in that caused you to think that that's
        the answer. Everybody has those days where you feel like sometimes you don't want to be here and that's fine
        to express; however, just for your sake, we will at least ask the authorities if they can contact you/your loved ones
        in some way, shape, or form to make sure that it's just been a really tragic day, week, or month, or just a bad phase
        you're going through and not an actual suicide threat.<br><br>

        Any user generated content posted in this forum does not represent any of the views of oSay. oSay is NOT liable
        for any of the content generated by the users of this forum. So if you have a problem with anything you see on this
        forum, your beef is with the creator of the content, not us. And again, if you do choose to engage them, do it RESPECTFULLY
        even if you feel like they haven't given the same courtesy. Trust me, we'll deal with them appropriately if we see it
        fit to do so.<br><br>
